		<h3>Third party licenses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>angular.js, angular-material and related libraries are released under the MIT license, stated above.</li>
			<li>Robots lovingly delivered by <a href="https://robohash.org">Robohash.org</a></li>
		</ul>
		The logviewer is not affiliated with twitch.tv or any other company that provides services, APIs or software used to create this product, unless stated otherwise.
		<h2>
			Privacy Policy
		</h2>
		I use Google Analytics to track the usage of the application, purely to improve the service where possible. All information this third-party service collects is therefore anonymous.
		<p>The information I gather is exclusively used to provide the service and is not used, given or sold to any third-party for any other purpose and is securely stored on my server.
		<h2>
			SLA
		</h2>
		No service license agreement is provided with this application, although I attempt to have the highest uptime I can achieve with the means I have access to.
		<h2>
			Donation Policy
		</h2>
		The logviewer is currently free for all users. I however reserve the right to sell additional features or options in a freemium model in the future, although no such system is currently planned. All monetary contributions are therefore considered donations and do not grant you any service license, uptime or liability agreement.
		<p>
		By donating to my PayPal, you are claiming that the money being donated is your own money and you are willingly and voluntarily donating this money. You acknowledge that you are receiving no items in return for this donation, and that the money donated is non-refundable.
		</p>
		<h2>
			API Policy
		</h2>
		<p>
			The API is free and open for everyone to use and supports CORS and JSONP. If you use the API to integrate the logviewer into your custom software, websites, apps or services, please adhere to the rules stated below:
			<ul>
				<li>The API is provided under a "fair-use" license. This means no api scraping, polling, DoSing, spamming, ... - try to keep each request to my API triggered by a user action. It is preferred to cache requests client-side</li>
				<li>Access to the API is restricted to purely non-commercial services and products, unless an extended license has been explicitely obtained. A user has to have access to whatever service you provide without payment, subscription or credit card information</li>
				<li>When displaying logs or stats of users, please always link back to cbenni.com - preferably with deep links like <a href="https://cbenni.com/esl_csgo/?user=cbenni">https://cbenni.com/esl_csgo/?user=cbenni</a></li>
				<li>The API is subject to change, and while breaking changes are rare, they might occur at any point in time - I take no responsibility or liability for changes that break your applications.
			</ul>
			If an application intentionally violates these terms, I take the liberty to permanently block it from access to my API in the manner I decide. Any future attempts to access or abuse my page, API or services will be prohibited and ultimately prosecuted.
