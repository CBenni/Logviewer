		<h2>
			Privacy Policy
		</h2>
		I use Google Analytics to track the usage of the application, purely to improve the service where possible. All information this third-party service collects is therefore anonymous.
		<p>The information I gather is exclusively used to provide the service and is not used, given or sold to any third-party for any other purpose and is securely stored on my server.
		<h2>
			SLA
		</h2>
		No service license agreement is provided with this application, although I attempt to have the highest uptime I can achieve with the means I have access to.
		<h2>
			Donation Policy
		</h2>
		The logviewer is currently free for all users. I however reserve the right to sell additional features or options in a freemium model in the future, although no such system is currently planned. All monetary contributions are therefore considered donations and do not grant you any service license, uptime or liability agreement.
		<p>
		By donating to my PayPal, you are claiming that the money being donated is your own money and you are willingly and voluntarily donating this money. You acknowledge that you are receiving no items in return for this donation, and that the money donated is non-refundable.
